# have-i-fed-the-cat-app

This application was part of a lecture/practical on an introduction to Sequlize. We built a simple web app to track when the cat was last fed!
It was a mob programming session with me as the 'driver' with the essential support of David Cheung, Rachmann, Abdi Issa, Jo Redmond, Jack Mills and Karen Coston.
The lecture was delivered by Ian King, Backend Tutor.
